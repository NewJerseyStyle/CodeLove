# Code Love: Source Realm
> "Where every syntax error is a heartbreak."

This game is a **Galgame-styled RPG** designed to teach programming concepts through the high-stakes world of digital dating. Inspired by a friend who wondered why learning to code couldn't be as dramatic as a visual novel, this project is a remake and a tribute to our friendship.

## 💖 The Premise

In most Galgames, you choose the right words to win a heart. In this game, you choose the right **logic**.

If you fail to understand a programming concept or provide the wrong solution, you don't just get a "Game Over"—you experience the soul-crushing sting of romantic rejection. It turns out that girls (and compilers) have very little patience for sloppy code.

## 🛠 Features

* **Failed Logic, Failed Love:** Branching narratives where your "Affection Points" (AP) are tied directly to your understanding of variables, loops, and data structures.
* **The "Punishment" System:** Incorrect answers lead to specific narrative consequences designed to help you remember the concept next time.
* **The Remake:** Improved mechanics, cleaner UI, and more rigorous "coding dates" than the original version.
